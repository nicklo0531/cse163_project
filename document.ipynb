These incidents often spark public outcry and debates about law enforcement. While the police has to do their jobs and securing their safety, the suspects also hold their human rights. Therefore, understanding the complex underlying factors behind police shooting is crucial for addressing this issue. \n","\n","Our team, consisting of three members, urge to disclose information beneath the surface about police shooting through the police shooting data we found online. By exploring the geographical hotspots, racial disparities, and contextual patterns in police shootings, we aim to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing dialogue on these critical issues. We believe that knowledge gained from this research can play a vital role in advocating for policy changes, raising awareness, and fostering a more equitable and just society. This project aligns with our commitment to using data-driven approaches to address complex societal challenges, and we hope that our findings will contribute to positive changes in policing and community relations."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### Research Questions\n","- Where are the geographical hotspots of police shootings in the United States from 2015 to the present day?\n","- What racial, gender and mental state demographics are disproportionately targeted in police shooting incidents?\n","- How has the total number of fatal shootings changed since 2015?\n","- How might data about police shootings disclose problems about social justice?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Data Setting\n","\n","[Data Source](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings)\n","\n","The dataset used for this project is the Fatal Force Database. This database, maintained by The Washington Post, provides detailed information about each police-involved killing in the United States since 2015. The dataset includes demographic information about the deceased, circumstances of the shooting, and details about law enforcement agencies involved. The data is collected through local news report, law enforcement websites, and independent databases since 2015. An advantage of this dataset is that it is up to the current date (v2), which would allow updated information on our analysis.\n","\n","_There are three ways the context of the dataset might complicate or deepen the analysis:_\n","1. Data Completeness and Timeliness:\n","- The dataset is continually updated, posing challenges in ensuring completeness, especially for recent incidents. This constant update introduces the possibility of encountering missing data for the most recent cases.\n","2. Demographic Representation:\n","- Certain demographic factors may have variations in reporting accuracy. For example, race and ethnicity data may be subject to different reporting standards, leading to potential complications or misrepresentation of certain groups.\n","3. Police Accountability Measures:\n","- The 2022 update standardized and published the names of police agencies involved, influencing the assessment of accountability at the department level. This alteration in data structure may impact the interpretation of trends related to police accountability over time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Method\n","1.

It can be indicated that there are more police shooting cases in major cities, such as Los Angeles, New York, Washington D.C., shown by the clustering of pinpoints. On the other hand, rural areas like Nevada, Wyoming have very few police shooting. In addition, there is an apparent difference between the east coast and the west coast, with the east coast having clustered police shooting cases. This might be because of population density, or even race, which we will dig deeper in the following report.\n","\n","Geographical Hotspots\n","East Coast:\n","- New York, Washington D.C, Alabama, Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando, Chicago\n","\n","Middle:\n","- Houston, Dallas, Denver\n","\n","West Coast\n","- Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### 2. What racial, gender and mental state demographics are disproportionately targeted in police shooting incidents?\n","\n","##### Racial Demographics:\n","\n","According to the analysis of police shooting data, it appears that individuals identified as White are disproportionately impacted, followed by Black individuals and then Hispanics. While whites account for the highest number of incidents, it's essential to note that the racial distribution does not necessarily reflect the overall demographic makeup of the population. When considering the proportionality of police shootings in relation to population size, minorities, particularly Black and Hispanic communities, are overrepresented in these incidents.\n","\n","##### Implications and Consequences:\n","The disproportionate impact on white individuals may be surprising and warrants further investigation. Possible explanations could include variations in reporting practices, socioeconomic factors, or disparities in policing approaches across different communities. The overrepresentation of black and Hispanic individuals in police shootings emphasizes the need for addressing systemic issues, bias, and reforming law enforcement practices to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all racial groups.\n","\n","##### Gender Demographics:\n","\n","Analyzing the gender demographics of police shooting incidents, the data reveals that approximately 96% of the cases involve male individuals. This significant gender imbalance suggests that men are more likely to be involved in police shootings compared to women.\n","\n","##### Implications and Consequences:\n","The skewed gender distribution may reflect broader societal patterns, including disparities in criminal behavior, societal expectations, or policing interactions. It underscores the importance of considering both gender and racial factors in discussions about police violence. Policymakers and law enforcement agencies may need to explore targeted strategies for engaging with male individuals in potentially volatile situations, emphasizing de-escalation tactics and alternative approaches to mitigate the risk of fatal outcomes.\n","\n","##### Mental State Demographics:\n","\n","Regarding mental state demographics, the bar graph indicates that a substantial number of individuals involved in police shooting incidents are not identified as mentally ill, while a smaller proportion is classified as mentally ill. This highlights that the majority of cases involve individuals without documented mental health issues.\n","\n","##### Implications and Consequences:\n","Identifying the specific mental health challenges individuals face can inform policies aimed at crisis intervention and mental health support. The data may reveal patterns in which certain conditions are more likely to result in fatal encounters with law enforcement. This insight could guide the development of specialized training for officers to effectively handle situations involving individuals with mental health issues, emphasizing de-escalation techniques and collaboration with mental health professionals.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["plotRace(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["plotGender(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["plotMentalState(df)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["##### 3. How has the total number of fatal shootings changed since 2015?\n","The data shows a concerning upward trend in the total number of fatal police shootings over the examined period. The consistent rise in incidents raises questions about the underlying factors contributing to this increase. Possible explanations could include changes in law enforcement tactics, public sentiment, societal unrest, or a combination of these factors.\n","\n","##### Implications:\n","\n","This upward trajectory underscores the urgency for comprehensive reforms in law enforcement practices, with a focus on de-escalation training, community policing, and addressing systemic issues that may contribute to the escalation of encounters. Additionally, policymakers should consider implementing measures to enhance transparency and accountability in policing to build trust with the communities they serve."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["plotTotalShootings(df)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Impact and Limitations\n","\n","#### Potential Implications of Results:\n","\n","##### Beneficiaries and Exclusions:\n","\n","- **Beneficiaries:**\n","  - Law enforcement agencies, policymakers, community advocates, researchers, and the general public may benefit from a nuanced understanding of police shooting data.\n","  \n","- **Exclusions or Harm:**\n","  - Individuals or groups might be harmed if the data is misinterpreted or selectively used to perpetuate bias, stigmatize communities, or undermine law enforcement without acknowledging the complexities involved.\n","\n","#### Impact of Data Setting on Results:\n","\n","##### Data Quality and Geographic Variations:\n","\n","- **Underreporting or Incomplete Data:**\n","  - Incomplete or underreported data might skew the analysis, particularly if incidents are not consistently documented or reported across jurisdictions.\n","  \n","- **Geographic Variations:**\n","  - Results may be influenced by geographic variations in law enforcement practices, reporting standards, and community-police relations.\n","\n","#### Limitations of the Analysis:\n","\n","1. **Causation vs. Correlation:**\n","   - The analysis may identify correlations, but establishing causation is challenging.
