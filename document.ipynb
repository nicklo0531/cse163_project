These incidents often spark public outcry and debates about law enforcement. While the police has to do their jobs and securing their safety, the suspects also hold their human rights. Therefore, understanding the complex underlying factors behind police shooting is crucial for addressing this issue. \n","\n","Our team, consisting of three members, urge to undermine information beneath the surface about police shooting through the police shooting data we found online. By exploring the geographical hotspots, racial disparities, and contextual patterns in police shootings, we aim to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing dialogue on these critical issues.We believe that knowledge gained from this research can play a vital role in advocating for policy changes, raising awareness, and fostering a more equitable and just society. This project aligns with our commitment to using data-driven approaches to address complex societal challenges, and we hope that our findings will contribute to positive changes in policing and community relations."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### Research Questions\n","- Where are the geographical hotspots of police shootings in the United States from 2015 to the present day?\n","- What racial demographics are disproportionately targeted in police shooting incidents?\n","- Are there patterns or trends in the circumstances surrounding police shootings, such as the presence of mental health crises or the type of weapons involved?\n","- How might data about police shootings disclose problems about social justice?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Data Setting\n","\n","[Data Source](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings)\n","\n","The dataset used for this project is the Fatal Force Database. This database, maintained by The Washington Post, provides detailed information about each police-involved killing in the United States since 2015. The dataset includes demographic information about the deceased, circumstances of the shooting, and details about law enforcement agencies involved. The data is collected through local news report, law enforcement websites, and independent databases since 2015. An advantage of this dataset is that it is up to the current date (v2), which would allow updated information on our analysis.\n","\n","_There are three ways the context of the dataset might complicate or deepen the analysis:_\n","1. Data Completeness and Timeliness:\n","- The dataset is continually updated, posing challenges in ensuring completeness, especially for recent incidents. This constant update introduces the possibility of encountering missing data for the most recent cases.\n","2. Demographic Representation:\n","- Certain demographic factors may have variations in reporting accuracy. For example, race and ethnicity data may be subject to different reporting standards, leading to potential complications or misrepresentation of certain groups.\n","3. Police Accountability Measures:\n","- The 2022 update standardized and published the names of police agencies involved, influencing the assessment of accountability at the department level. This alteration in data structure may impact the interpretation of trends related to police accountability over time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Method\n","1. Download Data: Use requests to fetch the latest dataset from The Washington Post's GitHub page.\n","2. Clean Data: Employ pandas to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and standardizing formats. (dates, categorical data)\n","3. Prepare Locations: Extract and possibly geocode location data with pandas or geopandas to get coordinates for mapping.\n","4. Mapping: Create interactive maps using tools like plotly to visualize shooting hotspots, with icons for details.\n","5. Study Race Data: Analyze racial data distribution with pandas, and visualize disparities using seaborn.\n","6. Look at Shooting Reasons: Use pandas to categorize shootings by reasons like mental health crises or weapon types and identify trends over time.\n","7. Bring Findings Together: Synthesize insights across analysis to address research questions, using pandas for data integration.\n","8. Write a Report: Compile findings and visualizations into a comprehensive report, potentially using Jupyter Notebook for an interactive presentation.\n","9. Work Together: Collaborate using JupyterHub for shared coding sessions, Zoom for discussions, and git for version control and code
