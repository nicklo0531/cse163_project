Authors: Mykyta Lepikash, Nick Lo, Brian Chiang


### Summary
Our research took a deep dive into police shootings in the United States. We have a total of four research questions targeted to understand more about the situation. From the interactive map, we can see an apparent difference between the police shooting incidents in the east and the west coast. We also found that males and individuals with mental illness are the most often targeted victims. While there is a higher number of white victims, the black population in the United States is lower than the white population, hinting possibilities of racism. In addition, we found cases of police with body cameras recording are significantly lower than those without one.

In essence, our project has disclosed information and valuable insights about police shooting through data science. We can use further data such as wealth distribution and public safety funds to further investigate this hot topic.
